# **Police Brutality**

> A horrifying case from Tamilnadu once again demonstrates the lack of accountability for India's police. In a macabre tale of bloodcurdling police brutality two man died in the custody in the port city of Thoothukudi . This is a flagrant human right voilation that cannot be allowed to happen in any civilized society. What happened to Jayraj and Benicks is only the tip of the iceberg in a country that has a history of such custodial deaths and that offers continued impunity for police officers who callously decimate human dignity .

Causes=) The hideous police brutality that rocked the United States is a daily occurrence in India , but unfortunately it doesn't spark the kind of outrage that can change the system . We've a criminal system that discourages prosecutors from pursuing police misconduct vigorously. In India , we all know about the gratuitous police beatings and custodial deaths and the indifference of politician to blatant state voilence .The problem is , As a society , we believe that the police have the right to be brutal , voilent and break the laws that they were sworn to uphold. But , Is vengeance the job if the police? And is the justice is same as vengeance.? Vicious police brutality, systematic atrocities, is not enough to get us on the streets.

> Article 21 of Indian constitution states:
>
> " No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to a procedure established by the law " This is the Procedural magna carta protective of life and liberty .

Apathetic attitude =)

Indian police act like a rowdy in our daily routine . Why they have the privilege not to pay street vendors for their food and auto rickshaw for their service ? We see them curbing the voices of the dissent in the name of law and order and doing fake cases at the will of their political masters . Is this the job of the police ? We've seen them extracting the money from the poor people. We see fear for the police in the marginalized. Why fear for the institution that is made to protect the rights for the marginalized and exploited? Why police became a puppet of politician ? Why we accepted the moral turpitude of indian police as a reality ?

So I am ending this with some lines that I hope will be helpful for self introspection among us :

Oh **dear**,

These incidents create an environment of **fear**;

Victims suffer with pain & unaccounted **tears**,

Let's raise our voice & make them(our system) **hear**!!
