Guru or teacher has always been considered akin to a God in the Hindu culture. Guru Purnima or Vyasa Purnima is the day to celebrate and pay our gratitude to our Gurus. This Sanskrit word literally translates to ‘the one who frees us of ignorance’. This full moon day in the month of Ashada is one of the most auspicious days of the year in Hinduism. India will celebrate Guru Purnima on July 5, 2020. It also commemorates the birthday of Ved Vyasa, who is credited to have authored some of the most important Hindu texts of all times such as the Puranas, Mahabharata and Vedas.

Guru Purnima honours Ved Vyasa, known as one of the most honoured Gurus of ancient India. Senior Ayurvedic consultant Dr Vishakha Mahindroo says, “Veda Vyasa, structured the four Vedas, composed the epic of the Mahabharata, created the foundation for the many Puranas and the vast encyclopedias of Hindu sacred lore. Guru Purnima represents the date on which Lord Shiva as the Adi Guru or original guru taught the seven rishis who were the seers of the Vedas. In the Yoga Sutras, Ishvara as Pranava or Om is said to be the Adi Guru of Yoga. Lord Buddha was said to have delivered his first sermon on this day at Sarnath, reflecting the power of this sacred time.”

Guru Purnima is celebrated to honour our teachers, who remove the darkness from our minds. They have a special place in the lives of their followers since ancient times. All the holy books of Hinduism dictate the importance of Gurus and the extraordinary bond between a Guru and his Shishya (disciple). An age-old Sanskrit phrase 'Mata Pitah Guru Daivam', says that the first place is reserved for the mother, second for the father, third for Guru and forth for God. Thus, teachers have been given a higher place than Gods in Hindu tradition.

Guru Purnima is usually celebrated by worshipping and expressing gratitude to the Gods who are like our Gurus. In monasteries and ashrams, disciples offer prayers in the honour of their teachers. Dr Vishakha suggests what to do on Guru Purnima, “On this day, one should dedicate oneself to following the guru’s principle and teachings and put them into practice. Guru Purnima has the importance of Vishnu puja attached to it. 'Vishnu Sahatranam' also known as the thousand names of Lord Vishnu should be recited on this day. Be in sync with self and channelise your energies on this auspicious day.”

Many people fast during the day, refraining to eat salt, rice, heavy foods such as non-vegetarian dishes and other meals made of cereals. Only eating yoghurt or fruits is allowed. They break their fast after performing puja in the evening. The temples distribute Prasada and Charnamrita, containing fresh fruits and sweetened curd. Most households also follow a strict vegetarian diet on Guru Purnima, eating delicacies like Khichdi, Poori, Choley, Halwa and sweets like Soan Papdi, Barfi, Laddoo, Gulab Jamun etc.
