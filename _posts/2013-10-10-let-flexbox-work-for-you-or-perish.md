Diriliş: Ertuğrul is a famous Tv series which has shattered almost all the previous records of any Turkish serials. The historical tv drama is based on the life events of Ertugrul Gazi, father of Osman Ghazi, the founder of Great Ottoman Empire.  
  
The Muslim empire ruled on vast area of lands including Asia and Europe. The show signifies the strength of a Muslim man who cares much for Allah, Prophet and Islam. The theme of the show attracted millions of Muslim visitors from all over the world.  
The influence exerted by this show is to such a great extent that a couple from Mexico embraced Islam. Truly, this charismatic show has left a huge mark on the hearts of Muslims who are suffering from every direction. This show helps them realize their glorious past and how their ancestors were.  
  
The couple reverted last year when they met Celal Al who played Abdurrahman Alp in the show. The couple recited Shahada (Islamic declaration of faith) in Celal’s presence when he was in the United States.  
It would be unwise to say that they accepted Islam in fervor rather after watching this show they did deep research and managed to throw away the dirt imposed on Islam’s image by western media and found out the jewel which we know as Islam.  
  
The couple was gifted two copies of Qur’an; one in English and the other in Spanish by Celal.  
He was there to attend the 22nd annual meeting of the Muslim American Society (MAS), a flagship Muslim organization, and gave a speech about the series and Turkey.  
  
The couple after reverting to Islam said, “‘’We were affected by Turkish TV series ”Resurrection: Ertuğrul’’ and Turkey’s humanitarian activities around the world, and then decided to become Muslim.”  
  
Ertugrul has garnered much attention from among Muslims for the portrayal of people who were true Muslims but also brought criticism. Famous Islamic scholar Dr Zakir Naik has called the show Less Haram and un-Islamic to watch.  
  
Nevertheless, the show has maintained its charisma and even four years after its actual release dominating the hearts and market.
