Addressing virtual ‘Jan Samvad’ rally of Gujarat BJP from Nagpur in Maharashtra, he also said India believed in peace and non-violence and do not want to be strong by becoming an expansionist. “There were six rivers in Akhand Bharat (passing through both India and Pakistan. As per division, waters of three rivers was reserved for Pakistan, while water of other three rivers was to be used by India. Water of our share was also flowing into Pakistan,” Gadkari said as per news agency.

We are working to stop the water from flowing into Pakistan. Now Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi, Uttarakhand and Himachal will get this water. Our government shows the courage to take this decision, otherwise nothing has happened since 1970,” he said.

His remarks came amid border tensions between India and China. “We should not make India strong by becoming expansionist, we should make India strong for establishing peace,” Gadkari said. “We never tried to grab land of Bhutan. Our country made Sheikh Mujibur Rahman the Prime Minister of Bangladesh after winning the war and our soldiers returned thereafter.”
