A teenage boy in Punjab lost nearly Rs 16 lakh from his parents’ bank accounts on the popular battle royale game PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds, better known as PUBG. The whopping sum of money was spent on buying in-app items, including artillery, passes for tournaments, and virtual ammunition over a month’s duration. The parents have claimed the huge amount was set aside as savings for the teenager’s father’s medical expenses.  
  
The 17-year-old Khagar-based boy told his parents that he would use the mobile phone for studying online. Instead, he was playing PUBG Mobile excessively on the smartphone of his father, according to a report by The Tribune. When making online transactions, bank account details and card details are mostly saved on the smartphone for later use by parents. The boy knew that his father’s bank account is linked to the smartphone, which he used excessively over a month’s period to buy various PUBG Mobile items.  
  
After the startling incident, the father has made the boy work at a scooter repair shop. “I just can’t let him sit idle at home and cannot give him a mobile phone even for studying. He is working at a scooter repair shop so that he realises how hard it is to earn money. I am hopeless now as the money was saved for my son’s future.”
